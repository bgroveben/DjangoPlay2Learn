# DjangoPlay2Learn
## Adding the Backend

In this project, you will be creating the backend for the Play2Learn website.
The website should allow users to log in to the site, play games, track their progress, see leaderboards, manage their account, and leave reviews.
Administrators will be able to run reports and manage users.
Any visitor to the site should also be able to fill out a contact us form.
You should be using Python and Django to add the backend.
You can use the JavaScript games you've created in previous projects.


Run Vue app on home page with links to both games using Vue routes and components. Pass scores and any other data to Django.


Configure Vue to not interfere with the Django template syntax (both use {{}} as delimiters). Try [[]] instead.
Configue Django urls to find Vue Components.
Use current homepage and url for games page, make a different Home page.
Static files for favicon, logo, and css stylesheet?
Email confirmation of registration?

Use Postgres database on the assignment page to set your models.
