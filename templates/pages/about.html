  <h2>About Play2Learn</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, I will be creating the backend for the Play2Learn website.
    The website should allow users to log in to the site, play games, track their progress, see leaderboards, manage their account, and leave reviews.
    Administrators will be able to run reports and manage users.
    Any visitor to the site should also be able to fill out a contact us form.
    I should be using Python and Django to add the backend.
    I am using the JavaScript games I've created in previous projects.
